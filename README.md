# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Customer Behavior Analysis is a process that involves examining and understanding how customers interact with a business, product, or service. This analysis helps organizations make informed decisions, tailor their strategies, and enhance customer experiences.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior for an e-commerce platform. By leveraging data on customer demographics, browsing patterns, and purchasing behavior, we aim to uncover insights that can help improve customer experience, optimize marketing strategies, and increase revenue.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about customer interactions with the e-commerce platform. It includes the following columns:
 1. User_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
 2. Gender: Gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
 3. Age: Age of the customer.
 4. Location: Location of the customer.
 5. Device_Type: Type of device used for browsing (e.g., Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
 6. Product_Browsing_Time: Amount of time spent browsing products (in minutes).
 7. Total_Pages_Viewed: Total number of pages viewed during the browsing session.
 8. Items_Added_to_Cart: Number of items added to the shopping cart.
 9. Total_Purchases: Total number of purchases made.

# Project Goals 

Understand Customer Demographics: Analyze the distribution of age, gender, and location.
Explore Device Usage: Investigate how different devices impact customer behavior.
Analyze Behavior Patterns: Study the relationship between browsing time, pages viewed, items added to the cart, and purchases.
Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on behavior using clustering techniques.
Optimize Conversion Funnel: Identify drop-off points in the customer journey and suggest improvements.
Revenue Impact: Assess how customer behavior impacts revenue and identify opportunities for growth.
